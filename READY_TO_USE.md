### 🚧 One Small Fix Needed (2 minutes)

**Issue**: Row Level Security (RLS) preventing data insertion

**Quick Fix**:
1. Go to your Supabase project: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ukygqtisuqpyxfadqdkk/sql
2. Copy and paste this SQL command:
```sql
ALTER TABLE f1_documents DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```
3. Click "Run"
4. Then run: `node simple-ingest.js`

### 🚀 Final Steps (5 minutes total)

```bash
# 1. Fix RLS in Supabase (run SQL above)

# 2. Load F1 data
node simple-ingest.js

# 3. Verify everything works
npm run check-setup

# 4. Start the application
cd ui && npm run dev
```
